# niklas9 shell

This is my repo for storing my shell settings and configurations, including

  * bash
  * vi
  * git
  * screen
  * s3cmd

## How to install
There's a `install.sh` script at TOT, it requires the `apt-get` package manager
though (typically included in any Debian-based Linux distribution).
