# niklas9 shell

This is my repo for storing my shell settings and configurations, including

  * bash
  * vi
  * git
  * screen
  * s3cmd

## How to install
There's a `install.sh` script at TOT, it requires the `apt-get` package manager
though (typically included in any Debian-based Linux distribution).

Quick install without having to install git:

```
curl -L -O https://github.com/Niklas9/shell/archive/master.tar.gz && tar -xf master.tar.gz && cd shell-master && ./install_all.sh && cd .. && rm master.tar.gz
```
